# E-Commerce SQL Analysis Project

### Project Summary & Key Findings

This project involved a deep dive into the Olist e-commerce dataset using PostgreSQL. The goal was to answer critical business questions regarding customer behavior, segmentation, and retention. Key findings revealed that the customer base is heavily skewed towards 'Low-Value' segments and that monthly retention drops significantly after the first purchase, highlighting opportunities for targeted engagement strategies.

### Database Schema (ERD)

The database is structured around a central `orders` table, which connects to customers, products, sellers, payments, and reviews. This normalized schema ensures data integrity and minimizes redundancy.

## Analysis & Insights

### Initial Data Exploration

This section includes basic queries to verify that the data was loaded correctly and to get a high-level overview of the dataset.

#### Query 1: How many orders are in the database?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```
**Result Snapshot:**

#### Query 2: How many customers are in each state?
```sql
SELECT
	customer_state,
	COUNT(customer_unique_id) AS customer_count
FROM
	customers
GROUP BY
	customer_state
ORDER BY
	customer_count DESC;
```

### BUSINESS ANALYSIS QUERIES
#### Business Question 1: Customer Segmentation

To identify our most valuable customers, I segmented them into 'High-Value', 'Mid-Value', and 'Low-Value' tiers based on their total historical spending. This was achieved by joining customer, order, and payment data, and then using a CTE and a `CASE` statement to apply the labels.

```sql
-- Segment customers based on total spending
WITH customer_spending AS (
  -- First, calculate total spending per customer
  SELECT
    c.customer_unique_id,
    SUM(op.payment_value) AS total_spent
  FROM
    customers c
  JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  JOIN
    order_payments op ON o.order_id = op.order_id
  GROUP BY
    c.customer_unique_id
)
-- Now, select from our temporary result and add the segment labels
SELECT
  customer_unique_id,
  total_spent,
  CASE
    WHEN total_spent > 1000 THEN 'High-Value'
    WHEN total_spent > 500 THEN 'Mid-Value'
    ELSE 'Low-Value'
  END AS customer_segment
FROM
  customer_spending
ORDER BY
  total_spent DESC;
```

#### Business Question 2: Cohort Analysis for Customer Retention

This analysis aims to understand customer loyalty and retention over time. I grouped customers into monthly cohorts based on their first purchase date and then tracked their purchasing activity in the subsequent months. This was achieved using multiple CTEs to first establish the cohorts and then to pivot the data into a monthly retention table.

```sql
-- Business Question 2: Create the final cohort retention chart
WITH cohort_data AS (
  -- This is the entire query you just successfully ran
  WITH cohort_items AS (
    SELECT
      c.customer_unique_id,
      DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(o.order_purchase_timestamp)) AS cohort_month
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_unique_id
  )
  SELECT
    ci.customer_unique_id,
    ci.cohort_month,
    (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ci.cohort_month)) * 12 +
    (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) - EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ci.cohort_month)) AS month_number
  FROM cohort_items ci
  JOIN customers c ON ci.customer_unique_id = c.customer_unique_id
  JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
),
cohort_counts AS (
  -- Next, count the number of unique customers for each cohort and month number
  SELECT
    cohort_month,
    month_number,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_unique_id) AS num_customers
  FROM
    cohort_data
  GROUP BY
    cohort_month,
    month_number
)
-- Finally, pivot the data to create the cohort chart
SELECT
  cohort_month,
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 0 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 0",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 1 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 1",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 2 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 2",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 3 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 3",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 4 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 4",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 5 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 5",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 6 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 6",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 7 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 7",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 8 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 8",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 9 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 9",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 10 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 10",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 11 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 11",
  MAX(CASE WHEN month_number = 12 THEN num_customers ELSE NULL END) AS "Month 12"
FROM
  cohort_counts
GROUP BY
  cohort_month
ORDER BY
  cohort_month;
```
